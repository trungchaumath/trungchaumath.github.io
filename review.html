<p>The Last Of Us Part 2	</p>

<p>A heart-wrenching story. Much like part 1, The last of us part 2 is a story with no classic good guys/bad guys. Everyone is a person with a relatable backstory, desires, regrets, and hopes. The thing is, they do not align, leading to people crossing each other's path a way noone wants them to. The producers have outdone themselves, telling a non-linear story with flashbacks that hit hard, and at the perfect time. SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!
</p>

<p>The story starts with Joel on a relaxing scouting mission with his brother Tommy, signaling that Joel and Ellie had arrived at the Jackson community safely, and they are having a closest-to-normal life there in an apocalypse. Joel told Tommy the story, that he and Ellie set out to seek the Fireflies group for a purpose: creating the vaccine for humanity.
Joel, as he admits, understands what Ellie wants. They have travelled across the country. Many lives were lost. Ellie needs them to mean something. Joel started to see Ellie as a daughter, as his daughter, and was ready to help her fulfill her wishes. 
They found the Fireflies in Salt Lake city. The doctors there were hopeful at the prospect of saving humanity, ending this fungal nightmare once and for all. The only catch? The surgery would have killed Ellie. 
</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ, Joel. What'd you do?" - Tommy asks. Deep down, he may have already known what the answer would be.
</p>
<p>"I saved her." - Joel looks up to Tommy, answers with a strong conviction. He genuinely believes it was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>
It is a lot of information for Tommy to take in. He takes a deep breath, then asks what Joel told Ellie afterwards.
</p>
<p>"I told her... that her immunity meant nothin'." 
</p>
<p>A brutal, and yet precise answer. Ellie believed her immunity was a once-in-a-lifetime thing, and that her life meant something bigger than herself. A crossing-the-country journey filled with people showing their true nature in an apocalypse was a lot for a 14-year-old, or anyone for that matter. 
She lost friends, allies, people she trusted along the way, and their death, could not have been for nothing. Joel thwarted this belief, hoping Ellie will have a normal life after leaving all of these behind.
Not a life where she is the world's savior, not a life which she sacrifices for humanity, but a life where she is not the chosen one, where she gets to make friends, where she is surrounded by people she loves and those who love her.
</p>
<p>Joel and Tommy ride horses back to Jackson, where we get to see a more organized community, and a safe haven. They arrive at Jackson. Tommy tells Joel that he would take this story to the ground if it were him. Joel understands. The first thing he does after getting back was paying Ellie a visit.
It is an awkward conversation. Ellie seems to be pushing Joel away. There could be many reasons for this, depending on how long they have been in Jackson. One reason may be because she is still suppressing Joel's suspicious story, a story that she at least knows cannot be the whole truth.
Joel offers to play her a song with the guitar he brings, fulfilling her request that one time when he was at death's door. She agrees.
Joel starts playing his classic song Future Days, with a remarkably slower melody than the original. 
</p>
<p>"If I were ever to lose you, I'd surely lose myself ..." 
</p>
<p>
This may be the first time after the Fireflies incident that Joel expresses his honest feeling to Ellie.
For a man famous for not knowing how to communicate his feelings properly, it shows courage. Joel gives Ellie the new guitar, iterating the promise that he would teach her to play,
and offers the first lesson the next day, to which she agrees.
Before Joel leaves, as maybe an effort to normalize their relationship, Ellies asks Joel if he remembers that joke he wanted to tell her.
</p>
<p>"What is the downside of eating a clock? It's time-consuming." - Joel replies. The roles have been reversed. Ellie was using the jokes to get to know Joel, and now Joel uses a similar joke to try to get a reset
on their relationship, which was hindered with a lie.
</p>
<p>
They smile at each other and say good night. Ellie can be seen pondering. Maybe, she is looking for a way to navigate her relationship with Joel. Maybe, she can get past his lies.
</p>

<p>
The story cuts to 4 years later. Ellie, now 18-19 year-old, gets woken up by a knock on the door. She realizes she had overslept, quickly gets up and opens the door. It is her friend Jesse. She apologizes, and tries to 
get back into her house to get ready for patrol. Jesse quickly gets his sentence in.
</p>
"I heard you had quite a night after I left."
<p>
"I..." - Ellie scrambles for a response, ridden with guilt - "She kissed me. It was just Dina being Dina. She didn't mean anything by it."
</p>

<p>
"I was talking about your fight with Seth" - Jesse quickly expresses his confusion, and asks for confirmation - "Wait! You kissed Dina?"
</p>

<p>
In the next half a second, Ellie realizes how little Jesse knows about last night. Her face alone expresses her next words - "Ooh! I thought that's ..."
</p>
<p>
"We're broken up one week and you made a move on my girl?" - Jesse interrupts. His voice is shaken with disbelief, and a hint of anger.
</p>
<p>
"No..." - Ellie breathes out, the air exits visibly in the cold weather - "She was probably doing that to make you jealous. I didn't... I would never.... Oh, fuck, this is awkward."
</p>
									
<p>
Jesse changes his facial expression. He now looks satisfying with how Ellie responds - "I'm just messing with you, man. I don't care. Get dressed."
</p>
