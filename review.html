<p>The Last Of Us Part 2	</p>

<p>A heart-wrenching story. Much like part 1, The last of us part 2 is a story with no classic good guys/bad guys. Everyone is a person with a relatable backstory, desires, regrets, and hopes. The thing is, they do not align, leading to people crossing each other's path a way noone wants them to. The producers have outdone themselves, telling a non-linear story with flashbacks that hit hard, and at the perfect time. SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!
</p>

<p>The story starts with Joel on a relaxing scouting mission with his brother Tommy, signaling that Joel and Ellie had arrived at the Jackson community safely, and they are having a closest-to-normal life there in an apocalypse. Joel told Tommy the story, that he and Ellie set out to seek the Fireflies group for a purpose: creating the vaccine for humanity.
Joel, as he admits, understands what Ellie wants. They have travelled across the country. Many lives were lost. Ellie needs them to mean something. Joel started to see Ellie as a daughter, as his daughter, and was ready to help her fulfill her wishes. 
	They found the Fireflies in Salt Lake city. The doctors there were hopeful at the prospect of saving humanity, ending this fungal nightmare once and for all. The only catch? The surgery would have killed Ellie. 
</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ, Joel. What'd you do?" - Tommy asks. Deep down, he may have already known what the answer would be.
</p>
<p>"I saved her." - Joel looks up to Tommy, answers with a strong conviction. He genuinely believes it was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>
It is a lot of information for Tommy to take in. He takes a deep breath, then asks what Joel told Ellie afterwards.
</p>
<p>"I told her... that her immunity meant nothin'." 
</p>
<p>A brutal, and yet precise answer. Ellie believed her immunity was a once-in-a-lifetime thing, and that her life meant something bigger than herself. A crossing-the-country journey filled with people showing their true nature in an apocalypse was a lot for a 14-year-old, or anyone for that matter. 
She lost friends, allies, people she trusted along the way, and their death, could not have been for nothing. Joel thwarted this belief, hoping Ellie will have a normal life after leaving all of these behind.
Not a life where she is the world's savior, not a life which she sacrifices for humanity, but a life where she is not the chosen one, where she gets to make friends, where she is surrounded by people she loves and those who love her.
</p>
<p>Joel and Tommy ride horses back to Jackson, where we get to see a more organized community, and a safe haven.
